    Before they begin the expedition, Sofia, Stephen and Nikola must learn to
    shoot at a target. This is for self defense of course as the journey will be
    fraught with perils and dangerous creatures who mean to do harm. To
    practice, the robotic trio have chosen an unassuming wall as their target
    for their training.
</div>
<p>
    On the shooting range shooters use a wall for practicing and trying to hit it from various positions.
    Shooters doesn't have problems with with vertical deviation, so we can use a simplified model.
    We placed a camera above the shooting range and
    use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system">Cartesian coordinates</a> to describe states.
    We know coordinates of wall (target) ends and shooting point.
    And we know the point where is a bullet after a small time.
    You should determine the result of the shot.
</p>

<p>
    You are given wall ends coordinates and two point coordinates which describe a shot --
    a start point and second point where is bullet after shot time (before a hit in the wall).
    You should calculate the result of the shot.
    If a bullet hit the wall in the center, then it's 100 points.
    And points reduce proportionality to distance of the center.
    The end point hit is 0 points. If a shooter missed, then -1 point.
    The result should be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_to_integer">rounded to the nearest integer</a>.

</p>

<p><strong>Input: </strong> Four arguments. Two wall ends, a shot point and an later point as tuples of two numbers.

</p>
<p><strong>Output: </strong> The results as an integer from -1 to 100.</p>

    <strong>Example:</strong>
<pre class="brush: python">
shot((2, 2), (5, 7), (11, 2), (8, 3)) == 100
shot((2, 2), (5, 7), (11, 2), (7, 2)) == 0
shot((2, 2), (5, 7), (11, 2), (8, 4)) == 29
shot((2, 2), (5, 7), (11, 2), (9, 5)) == -1
shot((2, 2), (5, 7), (11, 2), (10.5, 3)) == -1
</pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This concept can be using for modeling software and could help to determine the visibility of an object from a
    particular vantage point.
